# Node.js Backend Portfolio

Hey there! Welcome to my **Node.js Backend Portfolio**. This is where I keep a collection of all the backend projects I’ve worked on using Node.js. Each folder here is a different project, and I’ve included everything from basic APIs to more complex stuff I’ve built along the way.

## About This Repo

I created this repo to showcase the different things I’ve worked on with Node.js. It’s a mix of personal projects and experiments, and it covers everything from setting up simple APIs to handling more advanced features like real-time communication and secure user authentication.

## What’s Inside

- **API Projects**: A bunch of different APIs I’ve built for various use cases.
- **Database Integration**: Examples where I’ve worked with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
- **Authentication**: Projects where I’ve set up login systems and secure access.
- **Real-Time Features**: Some cool real-time stuff, like chat or notifications.
- **Error Handling & Validation**: Keeping everything smooth and secure.

## Why I Made This

This repo is a way for me to share what I’ve been working on and track my growth as a developer. I’m always learning and trying out new things, so this is a way to show that off. It’s also a place where I can look back and see how far I’ve come.

## How to Use It

1. Take a look around at the projects in the folders.
2. Each project has its own README file that explains what it does and how to run it.
3. Feel free to clone it and mess around with the code if you’d like!

## What’s Next

I’m planning to keep adding more projects as I keep learning and trying new things. So this portfolio will grow over time—hopefully with even cooler stuff!
